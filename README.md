Astronauts aren’t able to coordinate their sleep schedules with the rising and setting of the sun.

They can experience up to 16 sunsets in a 24-hour day, making it harder to transition back to life on Earth!

So we decided to create a "fake sun" so astronats will be able to follow the natural light cycles, and have one less thing to worry about!
