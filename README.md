# Sunsets in Space 
This is our sunset clock website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why we made this project 🚀
Astronauts aren’t able to coordinate their sleep schedules with the rising and setting of the sun. 

They can experience up to 16 sunsets in a 24-hour day, making it harder to transition back to life on Earth!

So we decided to create a "sunset clock" so astronauts will be able to follow the natural light cycles, and have one less thing to worry about!

It runs on UTC time which is the time zone that the International Space Station runs on.

The background color automatically changes at these times:
6:00 am => day
12:00 pm => afternoon
5:00 pm => evening
8:00 pm => night
