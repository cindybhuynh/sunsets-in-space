# Sunsets in Space 
This is our sunset clock website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why we made this project 🚀
Astronauts aren’t able to coordinate their sleep schedules with the rising and setting of the sun.

They can experience up to 16 sunsets in a 24-hour day, making it harder to transition back to life on Earth!

So we decided to create a "sunset clock" so astronauts will be able to follow the natural light cycles, and have one less thing to worry about!
